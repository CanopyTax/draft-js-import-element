# DraftJS: Import Element to ContentState

This is a module for [DraftJS](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js) that will convert an HTML DOM Element to editor content.

It was extracted from [React-RTE](https://react-rte.org) and placed into a separate module for more general use. Hopefully it can be helpful in your projects.

## Installation

    npm install --save draft-js-import-element
